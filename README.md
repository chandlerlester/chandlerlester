## Chandler Lester 

I study continuous-time macroeconomics and adaptive learning techniques, I'm also interested in machine learning. 

I have several public repositories on this site they include my academic website (a heavily edited version of [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)), a repository of replicated continuous-time value function problems (original version can be found on Ben Moll's [website](https://benjaminmoll.com/codes/), and code for my third-year field paper. 

On Github, I'm currently working on:
- Editing and posting more code from my dissertation
- Learning more about Julia's packages and applications 
- Brushing up on my Fortran and practicing R
